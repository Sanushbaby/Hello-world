# Hello-world
Trying to understand coding 
I am returning to coding after 18 months, initially i was programming just so that I could graduate or meet a deadline at my first job. A few weeks a go, i tried working on a website by following YouTube tutorials then an avalanche of nostalgia came back, and i asked myself why i was so intimidated of coding to begin with. So i decided to challenge myself by starting a fresh, this time i plan to be optimistic and enjoy the ride while rediscovering why i enjoyed development to begin with. #100DaysOfCode
